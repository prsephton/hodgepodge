Hodgepodge is a distributed component system based upon zope.interface and ZeroMQ.

Hodge provides a client side library for accessing remote utilities and data, while Podge provides a server based library for publishing interfaces which can be accessed via Hodge.

Some use cases:
	1. Python RPC
	2. Scaling Python apps through distributed processing
	3. Implementing data caches
	4. Event driven publish/subscribe

Status:  Very much still work in progress
